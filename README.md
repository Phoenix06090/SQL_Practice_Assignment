## **📌 Introduction**

Welcome to **SQL Assignment 1**, a hands-on project that involves writing, analyzing, and executing SQL queries to retrieve meaningful insights from a database. This assignment is focused on **shipment tracking, order fulfillment, and revenue calculations**.

💡 **Key Focus Areas:**

* Shipment tracking & analysis 📦  
* Order processing & payments 💳  
* Revenue & refunds 📉  
* Business performance metrics 📈

---

## **🛠 Prerequisites**

Before executing the queries, ensure that you have:

✅ A **MySQL or PostgreSQL database** set up. ✅ Access to the required tables (shipment, order\_header, order\_item, etc.). ✅ Basic knowledge of **SQL Joins, Aggregations, and Conditions**. ✅ A SQL execution environment (MySQL Workbench, PgAdmin, or any SQL CLI tool).

## **📊 Overview of Queries**

This assignment consists of **17 SQL queries** that cover key operational insights:

| 📌 Query Focus | 🔍 Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| 📦 Shipment Analysis | Count shipments, track shipments by ID, shipped units per location. |
| 📈 Performance Metrics | Average shipments per month, max fulfilled units. |
| 🛒 Order Processing | Last week's imported orders, multiple item orders, brokered but unshipped orders. |
| 💰 Financial Insights | Revenue per facility, shipping refunds, BOPIS revenue. |

## **📜 Query Details & Explanations**

Each query is designed to extract crucial business insights. Below is a summary of a few key queries:

### **📌 1\. Total Shipments in January 2022**

**Query:**

SELECT COUNT(SHIPMENT\_ID) AS Jan\_shipment  
FROM shipment\_status  
WHERE STATUS\_ID \= 'SHIPMENT\_SHIPPED'  
AND STATUS\_DATE BETWEEN '2021-12-31' AND '2022-02-01';

🔍 **This query helps analyze shipment trends during the first quarter of 2022\.**

### **📌 2\. Shipments by Tracking Number**

**Query:**

SELECT s.SHIPMENT\_ID, srs.TRACKING\_ID\_NUMBER  
FROM shipment s  
JOIN shipment\_route\_segment srs ON s.SHIPMENT\_ID \= srs.SHIPMENT\_ID  
WHERE srs.TRACKING\_ID\_NUMBER IS NOT NULL;

🔍 **It retrieves shipments that have valid tracking numbers.**

### **📌 3\. Average Number of Shipments per Month**

**Query:**

SELECT MAX(CREATED\_DATE) AS Maximum\_date, MIN(CREATED\_DATE) AS Minimum\_date,  
COUNT(SHIPMENT\_ID) / (TIMESTAMPDIFF(MONTH, MIN(CREATED\_DATE), MAX(CREATED\_DATE)) \+ 1\) AS avg\_shipment  
FROM shipment;

🔍 **Determines shipment trends over a period by calculating monthly shipment averages.**

### **📌 4\. Revenue Generated by Facility**

**Query:**

SELECT oh.ORDER\_ID, SUM(oh.GRAND\_TOTAL) AS Revenue, f.FACILITY\_ID, f.FACILITY\_NAME  
FROM order\_header oh  
JOIN facility f ON oh.ORIGIN\_FACILITY\_ID \= f.FACILITY\_ID  
GROUP BY oh.ORDER\_ID, f.FACILITY\_ID, f.FACILITY\_NAME  
ORDER BY Revenue DESC;

🔍 **Analyzes revenue per facility, helping businesses understand which locations generate the most revenue.**

📌 *More queries with explanations are included in the assignment document.*

## **🚀 Execution Steps**

1. 📂 **Load the dataset** into your SQL database.  
2. 🔍 **Understand the schema** (table relationships, column types, etc.).  
3. ▶ **Run each query** step by step in a SQL execution environment.  
4. 📊 **Analyze results**, tweak filters where necessary.  
5. 📝 **Document key insights** and observations.

## **🔮 Future Enhancements**

🔍 **Potential Improvements:**

* Use **stored procedures** to optimize query execution.  
* Create **views** for frequently accessed data.  
* Implement **triggers** for real-time data updates.  
* Improve indexing strategies for faster query execution.
